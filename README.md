- **Fun Way to Learn**: Making the learning experience interactive and engaging can help cement your understanding of these concepts.



## Dataset and Neural Network Considerations üß†
The CNN model is trained for educational purposes on a relatively small dataset. It provides a hands-on way to observe and understand model behavior and training dynamics:
- **Non-Optimized Performance**: The current setup is not designed for high-speed GPU execution.
- **Potential for Deeper Learning**: Extending the training to more epochs or enhancing the model architecture could yield more significant insights and performance improvements.

## How It Works üîç
From initializing parameters to processing data and training the model, "Count On Me: CNNs Edition" invites you on an insightful journey into the world of deep learning. This project builds on the foundational knowledge from [my previous "Count On Me" project](https://github.com/janescorza/count-on-me), advancing to more complex neural network structures.
