# Count On Me: CNNs Edition üéìüåü
**"Count On Me: CNNs Edition"** propels your neural network journey forward, diving into the exciting world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). This educational adventure uses hand sign recognition to teach not only the basics of number recognition but also the intricacies of CNNs, making learning both fun and technically enriching.

## Features üöÄ
- **Custom CNN from Scratch**: Dive into the nuts and bolts of building and training a CNN entirely from scratch. Watch as it learns and evolves with each epoch! Dive into the code to see who both the forward and backward models are built in detail.
- **TensorFlow Model Mode**: Coming soon! This mode will utilize TensorFlow to streamline model building and training.
- **ResNet50 Model Mode**: Also on the horizon, this mode will showcase the power of a pre-trained ResNet50 model applied to our hand sign recognition task.

## Getting Started üåü
Jump into this hands-on neural network experience with a few simple steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/janescorza/count-on-me-CNNs-Edition.git
   ```
2. **Create a virtual environment**: 

Run `python -m venv env` and then `source env/bin/activate` to create and activate the virtual environment

3. **Install Requirements**: 
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Launch the Application**: 
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   and follow the on-screen prompts to choose a mode and interact with the models.

## Prerequisites üìã
Ensure you have Python 3.6 or newer. Currently, the custom CNN does not utilize GPU acceleration and is optimized for educational purposes rather than performance.

## Modes of Operation üîÑ
### Mode 1: Custom CNN from Scratch
Experience the raw mechanics of CNNs by training a model from the ground up. Adjust parameters and observe the effects in real-time:
- **Training and Learning**: Despite not being the fastest due to its lack of GPU optimization, the model shows consistent learning across epochs.
- **Educational Focus**: Designed for demonstration, this mode helps you understand the fundamentals of CNNs.
- **Enhancement Potential**: Experiment with adding more layers, introducing regularization, or employing data augmentation to see how they can boost the model's performance.

### Future Modes
- **Mode 2: TensorFlow Model**: Stay tuned for an efficient TensorFlow implementation.
- **Mode 3: ResNet50 Model**: Explore advanced capabilities with a pre-trained ResNet50 model.

## Dataset and Neural Network Considerations üß†
The CNN model is trained for educational purposes on a relatively small dataset. It provides a hands-on way to observe and understand model behavior and training dynamics:
- **Non-Optimized Performance**: The current setup is not designed for high-speed GPU execution.
- **Potential for Deeper Learning**: Extending the training to more epochs or enhancing the model architecture could yield more significant insights and performance improvements.

## How It Works üîç
From initializing parameters to processing data and training the model, "Count On Me: CNNs Edition" invites you on an insightful journey into the world of deep learning. This project builds on the foundational knowledge from the previous "Count On Me" project, advancing to more complex neural network structures.
